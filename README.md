# Data repository for correlation functions of Yang-Mills theory in linear covariant gauges

This repository contains data for the ghost and gluon propagators of Yang-Mills theory in linear covariant gauges.
All data is given in physical units of GeV.
The content of the files should be understandable from the comments that can be found there.
Details can be found in [[1]](#YM_LC).
Subdirectories contain data for different setups, see table below.
For any questions related to the repository, please contact [Markus Huber](mailto:markus.huber@physik.jlug.de).
For general questions about the calculations, contact any of the authors of [[1]](#YM_LC).
