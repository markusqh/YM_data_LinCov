# Data repository for correlation functions of Yang-Mills theory in linear covariant gauges

This repository contains data for the ghost and gluon propagators of Yang-Mills theory in linear covariant gauges.
All data is given in physical units of GeV.
The content of the files should be understandable from the comments that can be found there.
Details can be found in [[1]](#YM_LC).
Subdirectories contain data for different ghost renormalization values.
For any questions, please contact [Markus Huber](mailto:markus.huber@physik.jlug.de).
The contained datasets are only a subset of the available data and correspond to the data shown in [[1]](#YM_LC).
